Function description

Swashbuckler Diary is an open source, cross platform local diary application. Half a lifetime of wind and rain, half a lifetime of travel, one's Jianghu, always needs to leave something to be wonderful.

Everyone has a swashbuckler in their heart, like a shadow following the wind, accompanying you to see the scenery all the way and remembering all your wonderful moments.
